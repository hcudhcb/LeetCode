Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.

For example, the following two linked lists:
```

```
begin to intersect at node c1.
```
```
Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,0,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
Output: Reference of the node with value = 8
Input Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect). From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,0,1,8,4,5]. 
There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.
```

```
Input: intersectVal = 2, listA = [0,9,1,2,4], listB = [3,2,4], skipA = 3, skipB = 1
Output: Reference of the node with value = 2
Input Explanation: The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect). From the head of A, it reads as [0,9,1,2,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [3,2,4]. 
There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.
```
![example2](https://github.com/hcudhcb/LeetCode/blob/master/image_leetcode/160_example_2.png)
```
Input: intersectVal = 0, listA = [2,6,4], listB = [1,5], skipA = 3, skipB = 2
Output: null
Input Explanation: From the head of A, it reads as [2,6,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [1,5]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.
Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.

My code:
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution(object):
    def get_length(self,head):
        count = 0
        n = head
        while n:
            count=count+1
            n = n.next
        return count
    def search(self,headA,headB):
        p = headA
        q = headB
        while p!=q and p and q:
            p = p.next
            q = q.next
        return p
    def getIntersectionNode(self, headA, headB):
        """
        :type head1, head1: ListNode
        :rtype: ListNode
        """
        
        lengthA = self.get_length(headA)
        lengthB = self.get_length(headB)
        print(lengthA,lengthB)
        if lengthA == lengthB:
            return self.search(headA,headB)
        elif lengthA>lengthB:
            length = lengthA-lengthB
            while length:
                headA = headA.next
                length-=1
            return self.search(headA,headB)
        else:
            length = lengthB-lengthA
            while length:
                headB = headB.next
                length-=1
            return self.search(headA,headB)
            
```
```
思路：
因为如果两个链长度相同的话，那么对应的一个个比下去就能找到，所以只需要把长链表变短即可。
具体算法为：分别遍历两个链表，得到分别对应的长度。然后求长度的差值，把较长的那个链表向后移动这个差值的个数，然后一一比较即可。

```
