```
Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Note: You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.
Example:

Input: [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49

1.DPï¼šTime Limit Exceeded(O(n^2))
My code:
```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height):
        """
        :type height: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        
        dp = [[0 for j in range(len(height))] for i in range(len(height))]
        max_s = 0
        for i in range(len(height)):
            for j in range(0,i):
                s = (i-j)*min(height[i],height[j])
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j-1],s)
                if dp[i][j]>max_s:
                    max_s = dp[i][j]
        return max_s
 ```
 2.sliding window,O(n)
 My code:
 ```python
 class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height):
        """
        :type height: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        i = 0
        j = len(height)-1
        old_s = 0
        while i<=j:
            if height[i] < height[j]:
                h = height[i]
                i=i+1
            else:
                h = height[j]
                j=j-1
            s = h*(j-i+1)
            if s>old_s:
                old_s = s
        return old_s
```
