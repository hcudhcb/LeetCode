```
You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image.

Rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

Note:

You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.

Example 1:

Given input matrix = 
[
  [1,2,3],
  [4,5,6],
  [7,8,9]
],

rotate the input matrix in-place such that it becomes:
[
  [7,4,1],
  [8,5,2],
  [9,6,3]
]
```
解题思路：先将矩阵转置，然后将矩阵的每一行翻转，就可以得到所要求的矩阵了。
My code:
```
class Solution:
    def rotate(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify matrix in-place instead.
        """
        temp = []
        for i in range(len(matrix)):
            temp.append([])
            for j in range(len(matrix[0])):
                temp[i].append(matrix[i][j])                                            
        for i in range(len(temp)-1,-1,-1):
            for j in range(len(temp[i])):
                matrix[j][len(temp)-1-i] = temp[i][j]
```
