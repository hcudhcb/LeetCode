Given a m x n grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.

Note: You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

Example:

Input:
[
  [1,3,1],
  [1,5,1],
  [4,2,1]
]
Output: 7
Explanation: Because the path 1→3→1→1→1 minimizes the sum.
```
My code:
```python
class Solution:
    def minPathSum(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        dp = [[0]*len(grid[0]) for i in range(len(grid))]
        dp[0][0] = grid[0][0]
        for i in range(1,len(grid)):
            dp[i][0] = grid[i][0]+dp[i-1][0]
        for j in range(1,len(grid[0])):
            dp[0][j] = grid[0][j]+dp[0][j-1]
        for i in range(1,len(grid)):
            for j in range(1,len(grid[0])):
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j],dp[i][j-1])+grid[i][j]
        return dp[len(grid)-1][len(grid[0])-1]
```
