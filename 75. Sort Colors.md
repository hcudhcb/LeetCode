```
Given an array with n objects colored red, white or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.

Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.

Note: You are not suppose to use the library's sort function for this problem.

Example:

Input: [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
```
My code:
```python
class Solution:
    def sortColors(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        red=0
        white=0
        blue=0
        for i in nums:
            if(i==0):
                red=red+1
            elif(i==1):
                white=white+1
            elif(i==2):
                blue=blue+1
                
        for j in range(len(nums)):
            if(j<red):
                nums[j]=0
            elif(j<red+white):
                nums[j]=1
            elif(j<red+white+blue):
                nums[j]=2
```
