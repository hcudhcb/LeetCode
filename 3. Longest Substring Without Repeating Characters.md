```
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Example 1:

Input: "abcabcbb"
Output: 3 
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. 
Example 2:

Input: "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
Example 3:

Input: "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3. 
             Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```
My code:
```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: int
        """ 
        pre_x = []
        max_len = 0
        for x in s:
            if x not in pre_x:
                pre_x.append(x)
                if len(pre_x)>max_len:
                    max_len = len(pre_x)
            else:
                pre_x = pre_x[pre_x.index(x)+1:]
                pre_x.append(x)
                if len(pre_x)>max_len:
                    max_len = len(pre_x)
        if len(pre_x)>max_len:
                max_len = len(pre_x)
        return max_len
```
